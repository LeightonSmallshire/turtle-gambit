# Mastermine
A fully automated strip mining network for ComputerCraft turtles!

Here's all the code for anyone who is interested! Check out the tutorial below for installation instructions.

Also, here are steps for a quick install via pastebin:

1. Place your advanced computer next to a disk drive with a blank disk in.
2. Run `pastebin get CtcSGkpc mastermine.lua`
3. Run `mastermine disk`
4. Run `disk/hub.lua`

## Play with or without PeripheralsPlusOne

I highly recommend using the PeripheralsPlusOne and its chunky turtles, but upon popular request I added the ability to disable the need for chunky turtle pairs. Just go to the config and set `use_chunky_turtles = false`
